History of Java
Java’s history is as interesting as it is impactful. The journey of this powerful programming language began in 1991 when James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems known as the “Green Team,” set out to create a new language initially called “Oak.” Oak was later renamed Java, inspired by Java coffee, and was first publicly released in 1996 as Java 1.0. This initial version provided a no-cost runtime environment across popular platforms, making it accessible to a broad audience. Arthur Van Hoff rewrote the Java 1.0 compiler to strictly comply with its specifications, ensuring its reliability and cross-platform capabilities.

Java evolved over time, with Java 2 introducing multiple configurations tailored for different platforms, showcasing its versatility.
In 1997, Sun Microsystems aimed to formalize Java through the ISO standards body but eventually withdrew from the process.
Despite not formalizing through ISO, Sun Microsystems offered most Java implementations at no cost, earning revenue by licensing specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
A significant milestone in Java’s history occurred on November 13, 2006, when Sun Microsystems released a large portion of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as free, open-source software.
By May 8, 2007, the core JVM code was fully available under open-source distribution terms.
Java was designed with core principles: simplicity, robustness, security, high performance, portability, multi-threading, and dynamic interpretation. These principles have made Java a preferred language for various applications, including mobile devices, internet programming, gaming, and e-business.
Today, Java continues to be a cornerstone of modern software development, widely used across industries and platforms.
